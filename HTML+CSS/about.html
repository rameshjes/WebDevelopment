      <!.. Class and ID concept, to give margin or spaces, we need to control
      them Therefore we will create class as container so we can control all
       elements together, class and id are different, an id is for something
        that is unique, like background for each section can be different
        therefore we can put that in id, where class is something you can
        use over and over ..>

        <p>When you have a great story about how your product or service was built to change lives, share it. The "About Us" page is a great place for it to live, too. Good stories humanize your brand, providing context and meaning for your product. Whatâ€™s more, good stories are sticky -- which means people are more likely to connect with them and pass them on.   </p>
        <p class="dark">Yellow Leaf Hammocks tells users about its product by describing how the hammocks empower artisan weavers and their families. The company breaks down different pieces of the story into sections that combine words and easily digestible graphics, painting a picture instead of big chunks of text. </p>
