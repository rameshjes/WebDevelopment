      <p> <justify>The original configuration of the Band ended its touring career in 1976 with an elaborate live ballroom performance
        featuring numerous musical celebrities. This performance was immortalized in Martin Scorsese's 1978 documentary The Last Waltz.
        The Band recommenced touring in 1983 without guitarist Robertson, who had found success with a solo career and as a Hollywood
        music producer. Following a 1986 show, Manuel committed suicide. The remaining three members continued to tour and record albums
         with a succession of musicians filling Manuel's and Robertson's roles; the final configuration of the group included
         Richard Bell (piano), Randy Ciarlante (drums), and Jim Weider (guitar).
         Danko died of heart failure in 1999, after which the group broke up for good.
         Helm was diagnosed with throat cancer in 1998 and was unable to sing for several years,
         but he eventually regained the use of his voice. He continued to perform and released several successful albums until
         he died in 2012.</justify> </p>
