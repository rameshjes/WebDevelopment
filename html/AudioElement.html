<p> There are several attributes for audio.
Inside audio element, there is source element. </p>

<p> If you have multiple audio files you need to use source element
only like for one audio file, one source element and for audio files,
two source element.  
Control attribute is used to provide control for audio file </p>
<p> Value for controls attribute is not neccessary , it is optional
If you want to play track automatically when page loaded then you use 
autoplay attribute and if you want to loop it
you can use loop attribute. </p>
<p>  you can use draggable attribute, in order to drag anything, this attribute
is general not for audio only. here you can forward and backward   </p>
<audio controls autoplay loop draggable="true">

<source src ="Satnam Satnam Satnam Ji - Pal Pal Japan Tera Naam.wav"/>
</audio>
